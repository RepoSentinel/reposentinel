# Phase 3 Complete: Main Repo Updated ✅

## Summary of Changes

Successfully migrated the worker to a private package and updated the main repository.

---

## Changes Made to Main Repo

### 1. ✅ Deleted `apps/worker` Directory

All worker code has been moved to the private package `@mergesignal/engine-private`.

### 2. ✅ Created `.npmrc` for GitHub Packages Access

```
@mergesignal:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=${GITHUB_TOKEN}
```

This allows the repo to access private packages from GitHub Packages.

### 3. ✅ Updated `README.md`

- Removed references to `apps/worker` from dev server instructions
- Updated architecture section to mention private worker package
- Added "Production Deployment" section with instructions
- Updated PR comments configuration note

### 4. ✅ Workspace Configuration

- `pnpm-workspace.yaml` unchanged (workspace glob patterns still work)
- `turbo.json` unchanged (no worker-specific tasks existed)

## Next Steps

### Step 1: Review Changes

```bash
cd /Users/yaronshafir/ventures/mergesignal

# Review what changed
git diff README.md
git diff .npmrc

# See all changes
git status
```

### Step 2: Test Locally (Optional)

Before committing, you can test that the repo still builds:

```bash
# Install dependencies (will skip private package for now)
pnpm install

# Build public packages
pnpm -C packages/shared build
pnpm -C packages/engine-stub build
pnpm -C packages/engine build
pnpm -C apps/cli build
pnpm -C apps/api build
pnpm -C apps/web build
```

### Step 3: Commit Changes

```bash
cd /Users/yaronshafir/ventures/mergesignal

# Stage all changes
git add -A

# Commit
git commit -m "Migrate worker to private package

- Move apps/worker to @mergesignal/engine-private
- Add GitHub Packages configuration (.npmrc)
- Update documentation to reflect new architecture
- Worker now distributed as private npm package"

# Push to main repo
git push origin main
```

## Repository Architecture (Before vs After)

### Before:

```
mergesignal/ (public repo)
├── apps/
│   ├── api/          ✅ Public
│   ├── web/          ✅ Public
│   ├── cli/          ✅ Public
│   └── worker/       ❌ PUBLIC (problem!)
└── packages/
    ├── shared/       ✅ Public
    ├── engine/       ✅ Public
    └── engine-stub/  ✅ Public
```

### After:

```
mergesignal/ (public repo)
├── .npmrc                    # NEW: GitHub Packages config
├── apps/
│   ├── api/                  ✅ Public
│   ├── web/                  ✅ Public
│   └── cli/                  ✅ Public
└── packages/
    ├── shared/               ✅ Public
    ├── engine/               ✅ Public
    └── engine-stub/          ✅ Public

mergesignal-engine/ (private repo)
├── package.json              # @mergesignal/engine-private
├── src/
│   ├── worker.ts             # BullMQ worker
│   ├── dataset.ts
│   ├── logger.ts
│   └── tier.ts
└── ...
```

## How It Works Now

### Development (for contributors with access)

```bash
# Clone public repo
git clone https://github.com/MergeSignal/mergesignal.git

# Set up GitHub token for private package
export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here

# Install (will fetch private worker package)
pnpm install
```

### Production Deployment

```bash
# Set GITHUB_TOKEN in environment
export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here

# Install dependencies (includes private package)
pnpm install

# Run API
pnpm -C apps/api start

# Run worker (from private package)
node node_modules/@mergesignal/engine-private/dist/worker.js

# Run web
pnpm -C apps/web start
```

---

## Security Benefits

1. ✅ **Worker logic is private** - Business logic, policy rules, alert algorithms protected
2. ✅ **Proprietary engine is private** - Analysis IP not exposed
3. ✅ **Platform is open** - API, web, CLI available for community/transparency
4. ✅ **Clean separation** - Clear boundary between open and proprietary code

---

## What's Public vs Private

### Public (mergesignal repo):

- API server (Fastify, routes, auth, webhooks)
- Web UI (Next.js frontend)
- CLI tool (local scanning)
- Shared types and contracts
- Engine facade (pluggable architecture)
- Reference engine implementation (engine-stub)
- Documentation

### Private (@mergesignal/engine-private package):

- BullMQ worker
- Scan processing logic
- GitHub PR comment generation
- Alert system
- Policy evaluation
- Tier management
- Dataset persistence
- (Optional) Proprietary analysis engine

---

## Troubleshooting

### Error: Cannot find module '@mergesignal/engine-private'

You need to:

1. Set `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable
2. Have access to the private repo
3. Run `pnpm install`

### 404 when installing private package

Make sure:

- Your GitHub token has `read:packages` permission
- You have access to `MergeSignal/mergesignal-engine` repo
- The package has been published to GitHub Packages

### Build errors after migration

The public repo should build fine without the private package. If you see errors:

- Make sure you're not trying to import from `@mergesignal/worker`
- The API and web don't depend on the worker directly

---

## Next Steps After Commit

### Publish Shared Packages to GitHub Packages

For production deployment, you may want to publish the shared packages:

```bash
# Publish shared types
cd packages/shared
npm publish --registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com

# Publish engine facade
cd packages/engine
npm publish --registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
```

Then update the private package to use published versions instead of workspace references.

### Set Up CI/CD

Update GitHub Actions workflows to:

1. Set `GITHUB_TOKEN` for package access
2. Build and deploy API and web
3. Deploy worker from private package
