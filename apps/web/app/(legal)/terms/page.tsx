      <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Effective Date:</strong> March 16, 2026
      </p>

      <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
      <p>
        By accessing or using MergeSignal (the &quot;Service&quot;), you agree
        to be bound by these Terms of Service (&quot;Terms&quot;). If you do not
        agree to these Terms, do not use the Service.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
      <p>
        MergeSignal is a dependency risk intelligence platform that provides
        risk scoring and analysis for software repositories. The Service
        includes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Web-based user interface</li>
        <li>RESTful API</li>
        <li>Command-line interface (CLI)</li>
        <li>GitHub App integration (optional)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>
        3. Our commitments; nature of the Service; warranties and limitations
      </h2>

      <h3>3.1 How we treat Customer Content</h3>
      <p>
        We handle <strong>Customer Content</strong> (as defined in the Privacy
        Policy) <strong>only</strong> to provide, secure, bill for, and improve
        the Service within the limits stated there. In particular, for the
        official hosted Service, we <strong>do not</strong> sell Customer
        Content to data brokers, and we <strong>do not</strong> use Customer
        Content to train generalized machine-learning models for unrelated third
        parties, as further described in the Privacy Policy.
      </p>

      <h3>3.2 Informational analyses (not professional advice)</h3>
      <p>
        MergeSignal produces <strong>automated dependency risk insights</strong>
        . That output is{" "}
        <strong>informational and decision-support only</strong>. It is{" "}
        <strong>not</strong> legal advice, not a professional penetration test
        or audit, and not a certification that a system is free of
        vulnerabilities or fit for any regulated purpose. You remain responsible
        for how you use outputs, for compliance with your own policies and laws,
        and for validating material decisions (for example, production releases
        or incident response).
      </p>

      <h3>3.3 No guarantee of specific results</h3>
      <p>
        To the <strong>maximum extent permitted by applicable law</strong>,
        MergeSignal <strong>does not warrant</strong> that the Service will be
        uninterrupted, error-free, or free of harmful components; that it will
        detect every vulnerability or misconfiguration; or that scores or
        recommendations will meet any particular business outcome or compliance
        standard. Third-party data sources (registries, advisories, hosting
        platforms) may be incomplete, delayed, or incorrect.
      </p>

      <h3>3.4 Open-source components</h3>
      <p>
        Portions of the software may be distributed under the{" "}
        <strong>Apache License, Version 2.0</strong>. The warranty disclaimer
        and limitation of liability in that license apply{" "}
        <strong>
          to those components in the form licensed under Apache 2.0
        </strong>
        . For <strong>hosted</strong> Service use, these Terms and the Privacy
        Policy also apply. If you self-host open-source components, you are
        responsible for your deployment and for providing appropriate notices to
        your own users.
      </p>

      <h3>3.5 Not legal advice</h3>
      <p>
        These Terms and our other policies are not a substitute for advice from{" "}
        <strong>qualified legal counsel</strong> about your specific
        obligations, industry, or jurisdiction.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL
        MERGESIGNAL, ITS OPERATORS, CONTRIBUTORS, OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR
        ANY:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>

          damages
        </li>
        <li>
          Loss of profits, revenue, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible
          losses
        </li>
        <li>
          Damages resulting from:

            <li>Your use or inability to use the Service</li>
            <li>Unauthorized access to or alteration of your data</li>
            <li>
              Any security breaches or vulnerabilities not detected by the
              Service

          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>

        (including negligence), strict liability, or any other legal theory,
        even if advised of the possibility of such damages.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          Some jurisdictions do not allow certain exclusions or caps; in those
          cases our liability is limited to the fullest extent permitted by law.
        </strong>{" "}
        Nothing in these Terms is intended to exclude liability that cannot
        legally be excluded (for example, certain forms of gross negligence or
        willful misconduct, where applicable).
