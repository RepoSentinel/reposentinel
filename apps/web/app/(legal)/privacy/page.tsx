      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Effective Date:</strong> March 16, 2026
      </p>

      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy describes how MergeSignal (&quot;we&quot;,
        &quot;our&quot;, or &quot;the Service&quot;) collects, uses, stores, and
        protects information when you use our dependency risk intelligence
        platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        By using MergeSignal, you consent to the data practices described in
        this policy.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

      <h3>2.1 Restrictions on use of Customer Content</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>&ldquo;Customer Content&rdquo;</strong> means data you (or an
        integration on your behalf) submit to operate the Service-for example
        dependency manifests, lockfiles, structured dependency graphs,
        repository identifiers, and analysis outputs-not your unrelated private
        business documents unless you choose to upload them.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the <strong>official hosted Service</strong> (and consistent with
        how self-hosted operators should treat their users&apos; data),
        MergeSignal <strong>does not</strong>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Sell</strong> Customer Content or scan inputs to data brokers
          or unrelated third parties;
        </li>
        <li>
          use Customer Content to{" "}
          <strong>
            train generalized machine-learning models for unrelated third
            parties
          </strong>{" "}
          (for example, selling embeddings or corpora derived from your
          repositories to model vendors); or
        </li>
        <li>
          use Customer Content for any purpose <strong>other than</strong>{" "}
          providing, securing, improving, and billing for the Service as
          described in this Policy and in the Terms of Service.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Improvements to the Service</strong> may use{" "}
        <strong>aggregated, de-identified</strong> statistics (for example,
        overall scan volume or error rates), security and abuse signals, and
        product telemetry that does not reproduce your confidential inputs.
        Where optional features need richer feedback, we will describe that
        in-product or in this Policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>What we persist:</strong> The Service stores what is needed to
        run analyses and show history-typically repository identifiers,{" "}
        <strong>lockfile or manifest-derived inputs</strong> you supply (or that
        the GitHub App sends for changed paths), structured dependency
        summaries, <strong>analysis results</strong> (scores, signals,
        recommendations), quotas, and audit-relevant metadata. We do{" "}
        <strong>not</strong> operate the standard product as a bulk mirror of
        your <strong>private application source code tree</strong> (for example
        every <code>.ts</code> / <code>.go</code> file in the repo); if a
        feature ever ingests more than dependency-oriented inputs, that
        feature&apos;s documentation will say so explicitly.
      </p>

      <h3>2.2 Information You Provide</h3>
      <p>When using the Service, you may provide:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Repository information</strong>: Repository names, owner
          identifiers, dependency graphs, and lockfile contents
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>API credentials</strong>: API keys and authentication tokens
          (securely hashed and stored)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>GitHub data</strong>: If using the GitHub App integration, we
          receive repository metadata, pull request information, and webhook
          events
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Organization data</strong>: Organization identifiers and
          settings for multi-tenant usage
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.3 Automatically Collected Information</h3>
      <p>We automatically collect:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Usage data</strong>: API requests, endpoint access patterns,
          scan frequency, and feature usage
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Technical data</strong>: IP addresses, request headers, user
          agents, and request identifiers
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Performance data</strong>: Response times, error rates, and
          system metrics
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Scan results</strong>: Risk scores, detected signals,
          vulnerability information, and analysis outputs
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.4 Third-Party Data</h3>
      <p>We may collect data from third-party sources to enrich analysis:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>npm registry</strong>: Package metadata, download statistics,
          and maintainer information
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>OSV vulnerability database</strong>: CVE and advisory
          information for known vulnerabilities
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>GitHub API</strong>: Repository health metrics, issue counts,
          and maintainer activity (if enabled)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <p>We use collected information to:</p>
      <ul>

          risk scores, and generate recommendations
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>
            Improve the Service (within the limits of Section 2.1)
          </strong>
          : Tune heuristics, fix bugs, and build <strong>aggregate</strong>{" "}
          product insights-without selling Customer Content or using it to train
          third-party foundation models as described above
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Maintain security</strong>: Monitor for abuse, prevent
          unauthorized access, and protect infrastructure
        </li>

          security issues, or service disruptions
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Enforce policies</strong>: Apply rate limits, quotas, and
          tier-based restrictions
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Generate analytics</strong>: Create aggregate, anonymized
          statistics about platform usage
